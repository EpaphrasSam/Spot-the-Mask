# Spot the Mask

A deep learning project for face mask detection using DenseNet201 architecture.

## Project Structure
- Jupyter notebook for model development and training
- Dataset organization in data/ and images/ directories
- Trained model weights
- CSV files for labels and submissions

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the dataset (if not included)
4. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Model
The project uses DenseNet201 architecture for mask detection with transfer learning.
